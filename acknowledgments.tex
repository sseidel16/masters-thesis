First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge and thank my supervisor and committee chair, Dr. Violet Syrotiuk, for constantly supporting me.
She reviewed every chapter of this thesis multiple times, and provided direction throughout the entire process.
Without her, this thesis would not have been completed and I would never have even applied to graduate school.
I am greatly indebted to her for all of her help and support.
Special thanks also goes to my co-supervisor and committee member, Dr. Charles Colbourn, for his valuable insight in combinatorics.

I would like to thank Dr. Douglas Montgomery for also serving on my committee, and providing his insight and expertise in statistics.

My dad, Dr. Mark Seidel, has been my mentor throughout graduate school and took time to proofread this thesis and provide feedback as well.

Thank you to my best friend for keeping me sane by talking to me daily on the phone, and convincing me to continue when I had every intention of dropping out.
